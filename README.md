# IsingModel_Simulation

Contains scripts used to explore the behaviour of a 1D Ising Model through Monte Carlo simulation.

## Overview of repository
- `ising_model_notebook.ipynb`: iPython notebook containing updated take on modelling the 1D Ising model using Python. Includes visualisations and context.
- `IsingModel_MATLAB`: Original MATLAB code created to simulate the 1D Ising model. Includes code and functions used to generate Monte Carlo simulation.
- `CATAM_Manual_PartII.pdf`: Booklet containing initial exploration prompts (see project 11.2)
